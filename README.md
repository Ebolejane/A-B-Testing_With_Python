# A/B testing for ux design

# Problem Statement:

In today's fast-paced digital landscape, businesses are constantly looking for ways to optimize their online presence, improve user engagement, and drive conversions. However, making data-driven decisions about website design, user experience, and marketing strategies can be challenging.

Many businesses struggle to determine which design elements, messaging, or calls-to-action (CTAs) resonate best with their target audience. Without a clear understanding of what drives user behavior, businesses risk making costly design and marketing decisions that may not yield the desired results.

A/B testing (also known as split testing) offers a solution to this problem. By randomly assigning users to different versions of a website, email, or app, businesses can compare the performance of different design elements, messaging, or CTAs. This enables data-driven decision-making, reduces the risk of costly mistakes, and helps businesses optimize their online presence for maximum impact.

## **Project Overview**  

This project demonstrates how to conduct an A/B test for UI design using a synthetic dataset. The goal is to determine which design variation leads to a higher **Click-Through Rate (CTR)**, helping businesses make data-driven UX decisions. In a real-world A/B test, we don't generate data immediately. Before running the test and collecting data, there are key preparatory steps to ensure the test is statistically valid and meaningful.

 **1. Define the Objective**  
Goal: Determine which UI design leads to a higher Click-Through Rate (CTR). 

**2. Select the Test Variable**  
UI Element: Call-to-Action (CTA) Button Design
Test Variants:
            Variant A (Control): Blue button with "Sign Up Now"
            Variant B (Test): Green button with "Get Started" 
    
**3. Identify the Target Audience**  
-User Segment: New visitors to a product landing page.
Traffic Source: Organic and paid traffic from search engines and social media.
Device Type: Mobile and desktop users.
User Assignment: Randomized 50/50 split:
                 50% of users see Variant A (Blue button, "Sign Up Now").
                 50% of users see Variant B (Green button, "Get Started").

**4. Determine Sample Size & Duration**  
Before running an A/B test, we need to know how many users should be included in each group (Variant A vs. Variant B) to get reliable results. If the sample size is too small, the results may be inaccurate. If it's too large, we may be wasting resources. To determine the right sample size, we consider four key factors:
1. Baseline Conversion Rate (CTR) – it tells us how things currently perform.This is the current Click-Through Rate (CTR) before making any changes. It tells us how many people, on average, click the button in the original design. For example, If 5 out of 100 people who visit the page click the button, the CTR is 5% (0.05). It gives us a starting point to compare the new design against. If we don’t know the baseline, we can estimate it based on past data or run a small test first.

2. Minimum Detectable Effect (MDE) – What change is worth noticing?. If our current CTR is 5%, and we want to detect at least a 1% increase, our MDE is 1% (0.01). So, we are testing to see if the new design gets 6% CTR or higher. If we set the MDE too small, we will need a very large sample size.

3. Significance Level (α) – How much error are we okay with. This is the chance of a false positive—seeing a difference when none exists.It is usually set at 5% (0.05). Meaning we are 95% confident that the results are real and not due to randomness. If α is too high, we might think the new design is better when it’s actually not. And if α is too low, we may miss real improvements.

4. Statistical Power (1 - β) – How confident are we in detecting a real difference?
